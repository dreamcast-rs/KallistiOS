gentexfont was written by Mark J. Kilgard in 1997 for converting X11
fonts into TXF fonts. If you want to generate TXF fonts, you can use*
the provided font2txf which takes TrueType/OpenType fonts instead of
X11 fonts.

I downloaded this from the web article which discusses TXF fonts and
included it here as a convenience. Note that this will probably not compile
under Cygwin (though it might... never know =) and so I haven't put it 
in the default build. You can compile your own by just doing "make" here.
